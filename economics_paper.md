Summary.  Recent anti-trust cases exacerbated the concerns of investors regard- ing the eﬀects of a ﬁrm’s monopoly power on its production choice, shareholder value, and the overall economy. We address this issue within a dynamic equilibrium model featuring a large monopolistic ﬁrm whose actions not only aﬀect the price of its output, but also eﬀectively inﬂuence the valuation of its stock. The latter renders time-inconsistency to the ﬁrm’s dynamic production choice. When the ﬁrm is required to pre-commit to its strategy, the ensuing equilibrium is largely in line with the predictions of the textbook monopoly model. When the ﬁrm behaves in a time-consistent manner, however, the predictions are strikingly at odds. The trade- oﬀbetween current proﬁts and the valuation of future proﬁts induces the ﬁrm to increase production beyond the competitive benchmark and cut prices. This policy may result in destroying shareholder value, and does indeed fully wipe out the ﬁrm’s proﬁt in the limit of the decision-making interval shrinking to zero, in line with the Coase conjecture.  

# 1 Introduction  

The pervasiveness of monopoly power, across many product categories in almost every part of the world economy, has long pre-occupied economists and lawmakers. There is also undisputed evidence that monopoly power is widespread amongst ﬁrms dominant enough to matter at an economy-wide level, the so-called “bellwethers.” This is evidenced by the series of ongoing anti-trust cases brought about by the U.S. government against, for exam- ple, IBM (1969 - 1982), AT&T (1974 - 1982), Microsoft (1994 - 1995, 1998 - present), and Bell Atlantic (1996 - 1997). Apparently, there is concern that these large monopolists may not just exert power in their own product mar- kets, but their actions may impact the overall economy. For example, as argued in the Microsoft case, US consumers and businesses alike feared to become critically dependent on Microsoft products. There are well-known dominant players outside the US, too. For instance, OPEC’s production decisions appear to aﬀect not only the oil producing countries’ economies, but also the overall world economy. While the surveys of imperfect competition by Hart (1985) and Bonanno (1990) have highlighted the importance of a general equilibrium analysis of such large monopolists, most studies of monopoly behavior have been undertaken at a partial equilibrium level assuming no impact on other markets. A true general equilibrium approach must face up to the challenge of accounting for the so-called “feedback” or “Ford eﬀect,” as once argued by Henry Ford: through the inﬂuence of its own actions, a non-price-taking ﬁrm may aﬀect the wealth of its customers, and hence the demand for the ﬁrm’s product. Finally, although there is growing work on general equilibrium asset pricing with market imperfections (e.g., see the survey by Sundaresan (2000)), the consideration of monopoly power is still missing in this literature.  
Our primary objective in this paper is to investigate the optimal behavior of a monopolist who has suﬃcient power to impact economy-wide pricing. We model the extreme case of an economy containing a single monopolistic ﬁrm who then, at a general equilibrium level, impacts the overall price of con- sumption in the economy. Beyond the traditional assumption that its actions impact the price of its own good, the ﬁrm’s actions also inﬂuence the valuation of its stock. As will become evident from our analysis, the dynamic setting we employ leads to a distinction between short-term and long-term policies of the monopolistic ﬁrm. (For a competitive ﬁrm, there is no such distinction.) Part of our emphasis will be to study the diﬀerences between the ensuing equilibria under short versus long-term policies.  

We adopt a familiar Robinson-Crusoe formulation of a discrete-time production ﬁnite-horizon economy populated by a representative consumer- investor-worker and a representative ﬁrm. The consumer derives utility from consumption and leisure, simultaneously invests in ﬁnancial markets (includ- ing the ﬁrm’s stock), and earns a labor income. The consumer’s labor is de- manded by the ﬁrm as the sole input to a stochastic non-constant-returns- to-scale production technology, producing the only good in the economy. We assume the objective of this ﬁrm is to maximize its market value, or the present value of its expected proﬁts. The ﬁrm has monopoly power in the good market, in that it takes account of the impact (via market clearing) of its production plan on the price of its output. In our setting, the monopoly power manifests itself as an impact of the ﬁrm’s labor demand on the state prices (or the pric- ing kernel). This manipulation of state prices results in time-inconsistency of the ﬁrm’s production strategy, in that it has an incentive to deviate from the initial plan at a later date. To rule out time-inconsistency, we focus on two dis- tinct types of monopolistic strategies: a “pre-commitment” strategy in which the ﬁrm initially chooses a plan to maximize its initial value, and thereafter cannot deviate from that plan; and a “time-consistent” strategy in which the ﬁrm chooses a plan each period, maximizing the value at that period, taking into account the re-adjustments that it will make in the future. Consistently with the literature (e.g., Blanchard and Fischer (1989,  § 11.4)), we interpret the time-consistent strategy as a short-sighted or short-term strategy, and the pre-commitment one as long-term.  
Solving for the pre-committed monopolist’s strategy reveals his optimal plan and the extent of his monopoly power to be driven by the concurrent proﬁt, the marginal product of labor, and the consumer’s attitude towards risk over consumption. The most immediate implications on the ensuing dynamic equilibrium are consistent with the predictions of textbook static monopoly models: lower good output and lower labor input, and higher price of consump- tion than the competitive counterpart. However, in contrast to the textbook case, proﬁts and the ﬁrm’s value can be either higher or lower. This arises because it is the ﬁrm’s initial value the monopolist maximizes, not the proﬁts nor the value at later times. By restricting production, he moves away from the competitive, proﬁt maximizing, production plan.  

The optimal behavior of the time-consistent monopolist contrasts sharply with that of the pre-committed monopolist. His optimal production plan and his monopoly power are driven by the negative of the ex-dividend stock price, in place of concurrent proﬁts. In attempting to maximize the current stock val- uation, this monopolist trades oﬀbetween today’s proﬁt and the ex-dividend stock price; hence the appearance of the ex-dividend price. In direct oppo- sition to the pre-commitment case, the equilibrium good output and labor demand are higher than the competitive case, while the price of consumption is lower. It is in this short-term monopolist’s interest to depress the current price of consumption, so as to boost today’s stock price. Yet more strikingly, the proﬁts in every period are decreased in the monopolist’s presence, and may even go negative, while the ﬁrm’s value can be either lower or higher than in the competitive benchmark. We also argue that our main conclusions regard- ing the time-consistent equilibrium hold true in the inﬁnite horizon limit of our economy within a parametric example. To further explore the robustness of these results, we provide an alternative, albeit extreme, form of a produc- tion opportunity (constant-returns-to-scale) under which the monopoly power vanishes, and the solution coincides with the competitive.  
It is well-recognized in monopolistic models of durable goods, that absent commitment the monopolistic ﬁrm may in a sense “compete with itself” across diﬀerent time periods, and weaken its monopoly power. The Coase (1972) conjecture proposes that as the time interval between successive decisions is reduced to an inﬁnitesimal length, this intertemporal competition will drive the ﬁrm’s proﬁts to zero. Since our long-lived ﬁrm’s stock resembles a durable good, it is of interest to explore the limiting case of our economies where the decision-making time interval shrinks to zero. While the competitive and the pre-commitment monopolistic equilibrium retain their basic discrete-time structure and implications, we ﬁnd the time-consistent equilibrium to tend to the limit of zero proﬁts and hence zero ﬁrm’s value at all times. Hence, un- der the time-consistent scenario, monopoly power destroys shareholder value. However, within our framework, this zero proﬁt limit does not coincide with the competitive solution.  

The importance of imperfect competition is, of course, well-recognized in many areas of theoretical and applied research. The standard textbook treat- ment of monopoly (Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995, Chapter 12), Ti- role (1988, Chapter 1)) considers a proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm which is the only producer of a good (and has no inﬂuence on other markets), in a static partial equilibrium setting. The main implications of the textbook monopolist are restriction of production and a raising of the price of output in the market for its product. While this behavior is consistent with the equilibrium im- plications of our pre-committed monopolist, it is at odds with those of the time-consistent monopolist. The distinction is due to our accounting for the economy-wide impact of the ﬁrm’s decision and in particular for the impact on its stock price valuation.  

In that regard, the most closely related work in a general equilibrium set- ting where the valuation of ﬁnancial securities is aﬀected by market power are the works of Basak (1997) and Kihlstrom (1998). These authors consider a single large consumer-investor acting as a non-price-taker in securities mar- kets, in a Lucas (1978)-type pure-exchange setting.   While the monopolists in Kihlstrom and Basak select a consumption-investment plan to maximize util- ity, our monopolist selects a production plan to maximize the stock price of his ﬁrm. In this respect, ours is much closer to the standard textbook monop- olist. Basak demonstrates that the non-price-taker acting as a price-leader in all markets manifests itself as a dependence of the state prices on the agent’s consumption choice. Kihlstrom relates the dynamic security price choice of the monopolist to the Coase (1972) conjecture, and shows that the inability of the monopolist to commit to the future (second period) price quote reduces his monopoly rents. Consequently, the ﬁrst period security price is less than in the commitment scenario (but is still higher than the competitive price). In the spirit of Kihlstrom, but with an additional moral hazard problem of the monopolist, is the dynamic model of DeMarzo and Urosevic (2001).   Ab- sent commitment, they demonstrate an analog of the Coase conjecture in the continuous-time limit of their economy.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the econ- omy. Section 3 characterizes equilibrium in the economy with a monopolistic ﬁrm for the cases when the ﬁrm can commit to its future production plan and when it cannot. It also presents comparison of the resulting equilibrium quantities to those of a benchmark competitive economy. In Section 4, we take the economy to its continuous-time limit and explore the Coase conjecture in the context of our economy. Section 5 concludes and the Appendix provides all proofs as well as discussions of alternative choices of the numeraire and the case of a monopolistic-monopsonistic ﬁrm.  

# 2 The Economy  

We consider a simple Robinson-Crusoe production economy with a repre- sentative ﬁrm and a representative consumer-investor-worker. We make the standard assumption that the consumer-investor-worker represents a con- tinuum of identical atomistic agents who take prices as given and cannot act strategically. The economy has a ﬁnite horizon   $[0,\,T]$  , in which trad- ing takes place at discrete times    $t\,=\,0,\dots,T$  . There is a single consump- tion good serving as the numeraire (other choices of the numeraire are dis- cussed in Remark 1). Uncertainty is represented by a ﬁltered probability space  $(\varOmega,\mathscr{F},\{\mathscr{F}_{t};\,t=0,\,1,.\,.\,.\,,T\},\mathscr{P})$   generated by a production shock process    $\varepsilon$  . All stochastic processes are assumed adapted to    $\{\mathcal{F}_{t};\,t=0,\,1,.\,.\,.\,,T\}$  , all stated (in)equalities involving random variables hold    $\mathcal{P}$  -almost surely. We assume all processes and expectations are well-deﬁned, without explicitly stating the required regularity conditions.  

The ﬁnancial investment opportunities are represented by: a risky stock of the ﬁrm in constant net supply of 1 share that pays out dividends    $\pi(t)$  ,   $t=$   $1,\cdot\cdot\cdot,T$  ; and enough zero net supply securities to dynamically complete the market.    $\pi$   is endogenously determined via the ﬁrm’s optimization problem. Dynamic market completeness allows the construction of a unique system of Arrow-Debreu securities consistent with no arbitrage. Accordingly, we may deﬁne the  state price density process    $\xi$   (or the pricing kernel    $\xi(s)/\xi(t)$  ,   $s\geq t$  ), where    $\xi(t,\omega)$   is interpreted as the Arrow-Debreu price (per unit probability  $\mathcal{P}$  ) of a unit of consumption good in state    $\omega\in\Omega$  at time    $t$  . The process    $\xi$   is to be determined in equilibrium. The time-  $\cdot t$   (cum-dividend) value    $V(t)$   of the stock (of the ﬁrm) is then given by  
$$
V(t)=E\left[\,\sum_{s=t}^{T}\frac{\xi(s)}{\xi(t)}\,\pi(s)\,\left|\mathcal{F}_{t}\right.\right]\,.
$$  

As evident from the subsequent analysis, our main results are valid in a de- terministic version of our model, where    $\xi$   has only one value in each period. We introduce uncertainty to make our formulation comparable to ﬁnancial markets models, standard in the literature.  

# 2.1 The Consumer’s Preferences and Optimization Problem  

A representative consumer-investor-worker is endowed at time 0 with 1 share of the stock, and at each time    $t$   with   $\ell$  units of available labor, to allocate between leisure    $h(t)$  , and labor    $\ell(t)$  , for which he is paid a wage at rate    $w(t)$  . The consumer intertemporally chooses a non-negative consumption process    $c$  , labor process  $\ell$  , and portfolio (of securities) process so as to maximize his life- time utility.   The consumer derives a separable von Neumann-Morgenstern time-additive, state-independent utility    $u(c(t))+v(h(t))$   from consumption and leisure in   $[1,T]$  . The functions    $u$   and    $v$   are assumed three times contin- uously diﬀerentiable, strictly increasing and strictly concave, and to satisfy  $\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname*{lim}_{c\to0}u^{\prime}(c)=\infty}\end{array}$  ,   $\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname*{lim}_{h\to0}v^{\prime}(h)=\infty}\end{array}$  .  

Under the complete markets assumption, the consumer-worker’s dynamic optimization problem can be cast in its Arrow-Debreu formulation as a static variational problem with a single budget constraint:  

$$
\operatorname*{max}_{c,\,\ell}E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T}u(c(t))+v(\bar{\ell}-\ell(t))\right]
$$  

$$
\mathrm{subject~to}\quad E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\xi(t)\left(c(t)-w(t)\,\ell(t)\right)\right]\leq E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\xi(t)\pi(t)\right]\,.
$$  

We do not explicitly apply the nonnegativity constraints    $c(t)\;\geq\;0,\,\ell(t)\;\leq$  ℓ,   $\ell(t)\geq0$  , because the conditions   $\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname*{lim}_{c\to0}u^{\prime}(c)=\infty}\end{array}$  and   $\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname*{lim}_{h\to0}v^{\prime}(h)=\infty}\end{array}$  

6 We introduce labor as one of the simplest, most commonly-adopted choices of input to the ﬁrm’s production function; employing labor does not introduce the intertemporal complexity of employing capital.  

7 We make the assumption of separable utility for simplicity, given our intention is to focus on a comparison of monopolistic behavior in a particular good market. Our analysis readily extends to the general non-separable case    $u(c,h)$  . Our major comparative statics results (Propositions 2 and 4) remain valid under the assumption −  $u_{c h}\geq0$   (which includes separable utility and Cobb-Douglas    $\begin{array}{r}{u(c,h)=\frac{1}{\gamma}(c^{\rho}h^{1-\rho})^{\gamma}}\end{array}$  , for    $\gamma\in(0,1)$  .)  
guarantee    $c(t)\,>\,0$  ,   $\ell(t)<\ell$  , while (in the equilibrium provided) the ﬁrm’s production technology (Section 2.2) guarantees    $\ell(t)\geq0$  .  

The ﬁrst-order conditions of the static problem (2)–(3) are  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{u^{\prime}(c(t))=y\,\xi(t)\ ,\ \ }}\\ {{v^{\prime}(\bar{\ell}-\ell(t))=y\,\xi(t)\,w(t)\ ,\ \ }}\end{array}
$$  

where the Lagrangian multiplier    $y$   satisﬁes  

$$
E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\xi(t)\left(c(t)-w(t)\,\ell(t)\right)\right]=E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\xi(t)\pi(t)\right]\,.
$$  

Consequently,  

$$
\frac{v^{\prime}(\bar{\ell}-\ell(t))}{u^{\prime}(c(t))}=w(t)\;.
$$  

# 2.2 The Firm’s Production and Optimization  

The representative ﬁrm in this economy faces the same information structure and set of securities as the consumer. At each time    $t=1,\dots,T$  , the ﬁrm uses labor,    $\ell^{D}(t)$  , as its only input to a production technology,    $f$  , which provides consumption good as output.   The technology is stochastic, driven by a shock process    $\varepsilon$  , assumed (without loss of generality) to be strictly positive. The ﬁrm’s output at time    $t$   is given by    $f(\ell^{D}(t),\varepsilon(t))$  . We assume    $f$   is increasing and strictly concave in its ﬁrst argument and that   $\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname*{lim}_{\ell^{D}\to0}f_{\ell}(\ell^{D},\varepsilon)=\infty}\end{array}$  and  $\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname*{lim}_{\ell^{D}\to0}f(\ell^{D},\varepsilon)\geq0}\end{array}$  . The ﬁrm pays out a wage    $w(t)$   for each unit of labor it utilizes, so its time-  $t$   proﬁt is  

$$
\pi(t)=f(\ell^{D}(t),\varepsilon(t))-w(t)\,\ell^{D}(t),
$$  

all of which it pays out as dividends to its shareholders. The ﬁrm’s objective is to maximize its market value, or the present value of its expected proﬁts under various market structures.  

The ﬁrm’s behavior is the main focus of this work. For the purpose of comparison, we ﬁrst consider the optimal choice of a competitive ﬁrm, and the resulting competitive equilibrium (Section 2.3), and then turn to an economy where a ﬁrm exercises monopoly power in the market for the consumption good (Section 3). In the latter set-up our assumption of the ﬁrm’s maximizing its value is prone to the criticism that applies to all equilibrium models with imperfect competition. To this day, the issue whether value maximization is the appropriate objective is still open (see Remark 1). Our viewpoint in this paper is to simply adopt the most well-understood equilibrium concept, the Cournot-Walrasian equilibrium, and despite its possible criticisms, focus on the implications. In particular, we interpret our representative consumer- shareholder as a standard Walrasian price-taking agent. As such, he perceives his decisions as having no eﬀect on the valuation of his consumption/labor stream, given by the left-hand side of the budget constraint (3). On the other hand, as a shareholder, he can aﬀect the quantity on the right-hand side of (3), his initial wealth, which is equal to the value of the ﬁrm. Monotonicity of his indirect utility of wealth, then, justiﬁes the ﬁrm’s value maximization as a desired objective of its shareholder.  
# 2.3 Benchmark Competitive Equilibrium  

The objective of the competitive ﬁrm is choose the input    $\ell^{D}$  so as to maximize its time-0 value,    $V(0)$  ,  taking the state prices and wage as given . The ﬁrst- order conditions for a competitive ﬁrm’s problem are given by  

$$
f_{\ell}(\ell^{D}(t),\,\varepsilon(t))-w(t)=0\qquad t=1,\ldots,T.
$$  

Deﬁnition 1 (Competitive Equilibrium).  An equilibrium in an economy of one competitive ﬁrm and one representative consumer-worker is a set of prices   $(\xi^{c},\,w^{c})$   and choices   $(c^{c},\,\ell^{c},\,\ell^{D^{c}})$   such that (i) the consumer chooses his optimal consumption/labor policy given the state price and wage processes, (ii) the ﬁrm makes its optimal labor choice given the state prices and wage, and (iii) the consumption and labor markets clear at all times:  

$$
c^{c}(t)=f{\big(}\ell^{\!^{D^{c}}}(t),\varepsilon(t){\big)}\ \ \ \ \,a n d\ \ \ \ \ \ell^{c}(t)=\ell^{\!^{D^{c}}}(t)\,.
$$  

It is straightforward to show from (7)–(10) that in the competitive equi-   librium, the equilibrium labor    $\ell^{c}=\ell^{D^{c}}$  is given by  

$$
f_{\ell}(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t))-\frac{v^{\prime}(\bar{\ell}-\ell^{c}(t))}{u^{\prime}(f(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t)))}=0
$$  

and the equilibrium consumption and proﬁt processes by  

$$
c^{c}(t)=f(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t))\,,\quad\pi^{c}(t)=f(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t))-f_{\ell}(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t))\,\ell^{c}(t)\;.
$$  

The equilibrium state price density, wage and ﬁrm value processes are given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\xi^{c}(t)=u^{\prime}(f(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t)))\,,\qquad w^{c}(t)=f_{\ell}(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t))\,,}\\ &{V^{c}(t)=}\\ &{E\biggl[\displaystyle\sum_{s=t}^{T}\,\frac{u^{\prime}(f(\ell^{c}(s),\varepsilon(s)))}{u^{\prime}(f(\ell^{c}(t),\varepsilon(t)))}\left\{f(\ell^{c}(s),\varepsilon(s))-f_{\ell}(\ell^{c}(s),\varepsilon(s))\ell^{c}(s)\right\}\biggl|\mathcal{F}_{t}\biggr].}\end{array}
$$  

The above conditions present a fully analytical characterization of the equilibrium, with (11) determining the labor as a function of the shock    $\varepsilon$   and then (12)–(14) determining all other quantities. Equation (11) states that the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure is equated to the marginal product of labor.  
# 3 Monopolistic Equilibrium  

In this section, we assume the consumption good market to be imperfect, in that the ﬁrm has monopoly power therein. We take the ﬁrm to act as a non-price-taker in its output market, taking into account the impact of its production plan choice on the price of output. The ﬁrm is still a price-taker in its input/labor market, taking the wages    $w$   as given. (The extension to the case where the ﬁrm is additionally a non-price-taker in the labor market is straightforward and is discussed in Appendix C.)  

We will observe that the ﬁrm’s production strategy is time-inconsistent, in the sense that a monopolist has an incentive to deviate from his time-0 plan at a later date. When the monopolist gets to time    $t$  , he no longer cares about the time-0 value of the ﬁrm; rather, he would like to revise the production plan so as to instead maximize the time-  $t$   value of the ﬁrm. In Section 3.1, we consider the optimal choice of a monopolistic ﬁrm that chooses an initial strategy so as to maximize its time-0 value and “pre-commits” to that strategy, not deviating at subsequent times. In Section 3.2, we solve for the time-consistent strategy of a monopolist who re-optimizes his production plan to maximize the ﬁrm’s current value at each date    $t$  , taking into account the fact that he is not restricted from revising this plan at the future dates    $s=t+1,\dots,T$  . The former can be thought of as a “long-term” strategy, providing the ﬁrst-best solution to the problem of maximizing the ﬁrm’s initial value. The latter can be interpreted as a “short-term” or “short-sighted” strategy since the ﬁrm continually re-optimizes every period to boost current value. We present the equilibrium for both cases.  

# 3.1 The Pre-Commitment Case  

We now formulate the monopolist’s optimization problem. Recalling the price- taking consumer’s demand (4), clearing in the consumption good market im- plies  

$$
\xi(t)=u^{\prime}\Big(f\big(\ell^{D}(t),\varepsilon(t)\big)\Big)/y\,.
$$  

The monopolist’s inﬂuence in the good market manifests itself, via (15), as a (non-linear) impact of its input demand on state prices. Accordingly, the pre-committed monopolist solves the following optimization problem at time  $0$  :  

$$
\operatorname*{max}_{\ell^{D},\,\xi}V(0)\quad\mathrm{~subject~to~}\xi(t)=u^{\prime}\Big(f\big(\ell^{D}(t),\varepsilon(t)\big)\Big)/y\,,\quad\forall\,t=1,\dots,T\,,
$$  

where    $y$   satisﬁes (6).  

Proposition 1 presents the optimal solution to this problem, assuming it exists.  
Proposition 1.  The pre-commitment monopoly optimal labor demand    $\ell^{D}$  ,  $t=1,\dots,T$   satisﬁes  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{f_{\ell}(t)-w(t)=A(t)\,f_{\ell}(t)\pi(t)\ >\ 0\,,}}\\ {{\qquad A(t)\equiv-\displaystyle\frac{u^{\prime\prime}(t)}{u^{\prime}(t)}\,,}}\end{array}
$$  

and  $f(t)$  ,  $u(t)$  and their derivatives are shorthand for  $f(\ell^{D}(t),\varepsilon(t))$  ,  $u(f(\ell^{D}(t),\varepsilon(t)))$   and their derivatives.  

The structure of the ﬁrst-order conditions bears resemblance to that of the textbook single-period monopolist. Any direct increase in proﬁt due to an extra unit of input must be counterbalanced by an indirect decrease via the impact of that extra unit on the concurrent price system. In our set-up, the extent of monopoly power is driven by the current proﬁt, the marginal product of labor and the (positive) quantity    $A$  , which captures the consumer’s attitude toward risk over consumption. (The quantity A can also be restated in terms of the textbook “monopoly markup.”) The higher the marginal product the more responsive is output to an extra unit of input. The more “risk-averse” the consumer, the less his consumption reacts to changes in the state price, or conversely, the more the state price reacts to changes in his consumption, and so the more incentive the monopolist has to deviate from competitive behavior. In the limit of a risk-neutral investor (preferences quasi-linear with respect to consumption), the monopolist cannot aﬀect the state price at all and so the best he can do is behave competitively.  

We now turn to an analysis of equilibrium in this economy.  

Deﬁnition 2 (Monopolistic Pre-Commitment Equilibrium).  An equi- librium in an economy of one monopolistic ﬁrm and one representative consumer-worker is a set of prices   $(\xi^{*},\,w^{*})$   and choices   $(c^{*},\,\ell^{*},\,\ell^{D*})$   such that (i) the consumer chooses his optimal consumption/labor policy given the state price and wage processes, (ii) the ﬁrm makes its optimal labor choice in (16) given the wage, and taking into account that the price system responds to clear the consumption good market, and (iii) the price system is such that the consumption and labor markets clear at all times:  

$$
c^{*}(t)=f(\ell^{D*}(t),\varepsilon(t))\ \ \ \ \,a n d\ \ \ \ \ \ell^{*}(t)=\ell^{D*}(t).
$$  

The fully analytical characterization of the equilibrium in the monopolistic pre-commitment economy is given by (18)–(21). Equilibrium is determined by
